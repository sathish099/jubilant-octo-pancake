    Make sure your project is on a Git provider like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

    - Connect your Git provider and select the repository for this project.

4.  **Configure Build Settings:**
    - For a static site like this, you typically don't need a build command or a publish directory. You can leave these fields blank, or set the publish directory to the root of your repository (`/`).
    - Netlify will automatically detect that you're deploying a static site.
